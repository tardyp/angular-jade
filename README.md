angular-jade
============

This toy angular.js module allows you to use jade templates inside html without need for build tools, thanks to angular js


DO NOT USE FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS!
================================
use a proper build system to compile your jade templates into real html (hint: grunt-jade)

This is meant for easy to understand examples, jsfiddle, etc.
